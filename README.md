# 06-Server-Side-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

## Description 

The purpose of this program is to simulate the functionality of a weather dashboard using api's to communicate with the front end and back end server. This program's functionality allows you to input a city and in response, receive weather conditions of that city. It utilizes local storage as well to save your recently selected values from the search box in the browser.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows a demonstration of what the finished web application's presentation and functionality will include:
